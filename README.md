Based on the provided information and summaries, I'll create a README.md file for the readme-bot project. Here's the content:


# Readme-Bot

Readme-Bot is a Next.js application designed to automate the process of generating and updating README files for GitHub repositories. It utilizes various services to summarize changes, manage file storage, and interact with GitHub repositories.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in package.json)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS account (for S3 storage)
- GitHub account and personal access token

## How to Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readme-bot.git
   cd readme-bot
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   

4. Set up the database:
   
   npx prisma migrate dev
   

## How to Run

1. For development:
   
   npm run dev

   * generate a greptile index. 
```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/greptile-indexes \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "repoName": "readme-bot", "branchName": "main"}'
```
   * generate a readme.
```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/readmes \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "repoName": "readme-bot", "branchName": "main"}'
```
   * get a readme
```
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/readmes/readme-bot/main
```
   

2. For production:
   
   npm run build
   npm start
   

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Test

Run the linter:

npm run lint


Note: Additional testing scripts should be added in the future.

## Table Relationships

The project uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Here's a simplified representation of the database schema:
