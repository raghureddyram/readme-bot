## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose:
   - For Windows and Mac: Download and install from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
   - For Linux: Follow the Linux-specific instructions on the Docker installation page.

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Build the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - API routes: `localhost:3000/api/[route]`
   - Prisma Studio: `localhost:5555`

## Project Structure

- `/app`: Contains Next.js application files
- `/pages/api`: API routes for answers, comments, questions, and users
- `/prisma`: Prisma schema, migrations, and seed data

## API Routes

- Questions: `/api/questions`
- Answers: `/api/answers`
- Comments: `/api/comments`
- Users: `/api/users`

Each route supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations where applicable.

## Database Schema

### User
- id: Int (Primary Key)
- name: String
- archivedAt: DateTime? (for soft delete)

### Question
- id: Int (Primary Key)
- title: String
- body: String
- createdAt: DateTime
- score: Int
- userId: Int (Foreign Key to User)

### Answer
- id: Int (Primary Key)
- body: String
- createdAt: DateTime
- score: Int
- questionId: Int (Foreign Key to Question)
- userId: Int (Foreign Key to User)

### Comment
- id: Int (Primary Key)
- body: String
- createdAt: DateTime
- userId: Int (Foreign Key to User)
- questionId: Int? (Foreign Key to Question)
- answerId: Int? (Foreign Key to Answer)

## Testing

(Information about testing is not provided in the given context. You may want to add details about your testing strategy and how to run tests once implemented.)

## Design Decisions

1. **Soft Delete for Users**: Users are archived instead of hard deleted to preserve content integrity.
2. **File Colocation**: Repository files are placed next to routing files for easier navigation.
3. **Query Separation**: Complex queries are separated into repository files.
4. **Indexing**: Appropriate indexes are added to enhance query performance.
5. **Input Validation**: Inputs are validated on ingress to ensure data integrity.
6. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP errors and responses are implemented for better error management.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including setup instructions, project structure, API routes, database schema, and key design decisions. You may want to expand on the testing section once you have implemented a testing strategy.
