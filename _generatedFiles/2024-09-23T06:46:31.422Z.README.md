# StackOverflow Clone

A Next.js application that replicates core functionalities of StackOverflow, using PostgreSQL for data storage and Prisma as the ORM.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installing Docker and Docker Compose

#### Docker

Download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

- For **Windows** and **Mac**: Follow the installer instructions on the Docker website.
- For **Linux**: Follow the Linux-specific instructions on the Docker installation page.

#### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is typically included with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac. For Linux:

bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Verify installation:
bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version


## Setup and Running the Application

1. **Build the Docker container:**
   bash
   docker-compose build
   

2. **Start the application:**
   bash
   docker-compose up
   

3. **Access the API:**
   - Index routes:
     - `localhost:3000/api/questions`
     - `localhost:3000/api/answers`
     - `localhost:3000/api/users`
     - `localhost:3000/api/comments`
   - Show routes:
     - `localhost:3000/api/questions/1`
     - `localhost:3000/api/answers/1`
     - `localhost:3000/api/users/1`
     - `localhost:3000/api/comments/1`

4. **Create data using curl:**
   bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/answers \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "body":"This is the answer body", "questionId": {replace_valid_question_id}, "userId": {replace_valid_user_id}}'
   

5. **View database data:**
   - Navigate to `localhost:5555` for Prisma Studio
   - Select models: User, Question, Comment, or Answer

## Database Schema

### User Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | INT       | Primary Key |
| name        | STRING    | User's name |
| archivedAt  | DATETIME  | Soft delete timestamp |

### Question Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | INT       | Primary Key |
| title       | STRING    | Question title |
| body        | TEXT      | Question content |
| createdAt   | DATETIME  | Creation timestamp |
| score       | INT       | Question score |
| userId      | INT       | Foreign Key to User |

### Answer Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | INT       | Primary Key |
| body        | TEXT      | Answer content |
| createdAt   | DATETIME  | Creation timestamp |
| score       | INT       | Answer score |
| userId      | INT       | Foreign Key to User |
| questionId  | INT       | Foreign Key to Question |

### Comment Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | INT       | Primary Key |
| body        | TEXT      | Comment content |
| createdAt   | DATETIME  | Creation timestamp |
| userId      | INT       | Foreign Key to User |
| questionId  | INT       | Foreign Key to Question (optional) |
| answerId    | INT       | Foreign Key to Answer (optional) |

## Architecture and Design Decisions

1. **Soft Delete for Users**: Users are soft-deleted to preserve their content while marking them as inactive.
2. **Repository Pattern**: Database operations are abstracted into repository files for better organization.
3. **API Structure**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated files for each entity (questions, answers, comments, users).
4. **Database Indexing**: Appropriate indexes are created to optimize query performance.
5. **Input Validation**: Implemented on API ingress to ensure data integrity.
6. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses are used throughout the API.

## Testing

To implement tests:
1. Add a test directory (e.g., `__tests__`) in the project root.
2. Create test files for each component or functionality (e.g., `questions.test.ts`).
3. Use a testing framework like Jest, and add test scripts to `package.json`.

## Possible Enhancements

1. Implement user authentication and authorization.
2. Add pagination for list endpoints.
3. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.
4. Add a search functionality for questions and answers.
5. Implement a voting system for questions and answers.
6. Add tags to questions for better categorization.
7. Implement a notification system for users.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
