Based on the provided information, I've created a comprehensive README.md file for the StackOverflow Clone project. Here's the content:

# StackOverflow Clone

This project is a StackOverflow-like question-and-answer platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installing Docker and Docker Compose

#### Docker

Download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

- **Windows** and **Mac**: Follow the installer instructions on the Docker website.
- **Linux**: Follow the Linux-specific instructions on the Docker installation page.

#### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is typically included with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac. For Linux:

bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Verify installation:
bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version


## Setup and Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stackoverflowclone
   

2. Build the Docker container:
   bash
   docker-compose build
   

3. Start the application:
   bash
   docker-compose up
   

4. Access the application:
   - API endpoints: `http://localhost:3000/api/`
   - Prisma Studio: `http://localhost:5555`

## API Endpoints

- Questions: `/api/questions`
- Answers: `/api/answers`
- Users: `/api/users`
- Comments: `/api/comments`

Example of creating data using curl:
bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/answers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "body":"This is the answer body", "questionId": 1, "userId": 1}'


## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- User
- Question
- Answer
- Comment

For detailed schema information, refer to `/prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

1. **Soft Delete for Users**: Users are soft-deleted to preserve their content while marking them as deleted.
2. **File Structure**: Repository files are colocated with routing files for easier navigation.
3. **Query Management**: Complex queries are broken out into repository files.
4. **Database Optimization**: Appropriate indexing is implemented for better performance.
5. **Input Validation**: Inputs are validated on ingress to ensure data integrity.
6. **Error Handling**: Appropriate HTTP errors and responses are implemented.

## Development

- The project uses Next.js with TypeScript.
- Prisma is used as the ORM for database management.
- ESLint is configured for code quality and consistency.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

bash
npm run test
