# Vision Extract

Vision Extract is a Django-based project that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o to parse images of PDFs and extract financial information from them.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/raghureddyram/vision-extract.git
   cd vision-extract
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   poetry run python vision/manage.py migrate
   ```

## How to Run

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```
   poetry run python vision/manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Available Endpoints

- `/pdf_viewer/{pdf_name}`: Renders the specified PDF in a webpage.
  Example: `http://localhost:8000/pdf_viewer/sample`

- `/pdf_viewer/process`: Processes all PDFs in the `source_pdfs` directory, converting relevant pages to images.
  Example: `http://localhost:8000/pdf_viewer/process`

- `/extractions/sample`: Provides JSON output of the extractions made from the sample PDF.

## How to Test

Run the tests using pytest:
```
poetry run pytest
```

## Architecture

The project is structured as a Django application with two main components:

1. `pdf_viewer`: Handles the conversion of PDFs to images and displays them.
2. `extractions`: Processes the PDF images using OpenAI's GPT-4o to extract financial information.

### Key Components:

- `AiServiceAgent`: Manages the interaction with OpenAI's API for extracting information from images.
- `ImageConverter`: Converts PDF pages to images, focusing on relevant pages.
- Django views: Handle HTTP requests and responses for the web interface.

## Data Flow

1. PDFs are uploaded to the `source_pdfs` directory.
2. The `/pdf_viewer/process` endpoint converts relevant PDF pages to images.
3. The `AiServiceAgent` processes these images, extracting financial information.
4. Extracted data is structured using Pydantic models.
5. The structured data is returned as JSON through the `/extractions/{pdf_name}` endpoint.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add more comprehensive test coverage.
- Optimize image processing for larger PDFs.
- Implement caching to improve performance for repeated extractions.
