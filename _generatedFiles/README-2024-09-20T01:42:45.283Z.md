# StackOverflow Clone

This project is a StackOverflow-like clone built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM. It provides a full-stack application with API routes for managing users, questions, answers, and comments.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

#### Docker

To run this project, you need to have Docker installed. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

- For **Windows** and **Mac**: Follow the installer instructions on the Docker website.
- For **Linux**: Follow the Linux-specific instructions on the Docker installation page.

#### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is typically included with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac. If you're on Linux, you may need to install it separately.

- **Linux**: You can install Docker Compose by running the following command:
  
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  ```

To verify the installation:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### 2. Build the Docker Container

After installing Docker and Docker Compose, you can build the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 3. Run the Application

Start the container. This will start the app server, the database, and Prisma Studio:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 4. Access the API

You can now access the API endpoints:

- Examples of index routes:
  - `localhost:3000/api/questions`
  - `localhost:3000/api/answers`
  - `localhost:3000/api/users`
  - `localhost:3000/api/comments`

- Examples of show routes:
  - `localhost:3000/api/questions/1`
  - `localhost:3000/api/answers/1`
  - `localhost:3000/api/users/1`
  - `localhost:3000/api/comments/1`

- Use curl for creating data:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/answers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "body":"This is the answer body", "questionId": {replace_valid_question_id}, "userId": {replace_valid_user_id}}'
```

### 5. View the Database

To view the data in the database using Prisma Studio:
1. Navigate to `localhost:5555`
2. Select the model you want to view (User, Question, Comment, or Answer)

Note: Prisma Studio may take a second or two to boot up after `docker-compose up`.

## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- **User**: Stores user information
- **Question**: Stores questions posted by users
- **Answer**: Stores answers to questions
- **Comment**: Stores comments on both questions and answers

For detailed schema information, refer to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

## Development

- The project uses Next.js for the frontend and API routes.
- Prisma is used as the ORM for database operations.
- The application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Testing

To test the API endpoints, you can use tools like curl or Postman to send requests to the various routes.

## Design Decisions

- **Soft Delete Users**: Users are soft-deleted to preserve their content while marking them as deleted.
- **File Structure**: Related files (e.g., repositories and route files) are colocated for easier navigation.
- **Query Organization**: Complex queries are broken out into repository files.
- **Indexing**: Appropriate indexes are added to improve query performance.
- **Input Validation**: Inputs are validated on ingress to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate HTTP errors and responses are implemented.
