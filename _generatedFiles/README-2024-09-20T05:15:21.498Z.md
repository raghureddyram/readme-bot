Based on the provided information, I'll create a README.md file that covers the key considerations you mentioned. Here's the README.md content:


# StackOverflow Clone

This project is a StackOverflow-like question and answer platform built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/raghureddyram/stackoverflowclone.git
   cd stackoverflowclone
   

2. Build the Docker container:
   
   docker-compose build
   

## How to Run

1. Start the application:
   
   docker-compose up
   

2. Access the application:
   - API endpoints: `http://localhost:3000/api`
   - Prisma Studio: `http://localhost:5555`

## API Routes

- Questions: `/api/questions`
- Answers: `/api/answers`
- Comments: `/api/comments`
- Users: `/api/users`

Example GET request:

curl http://localhost:3000/api/questions


Example POST request:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/answers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "body":"This is the answer body", "questionId": 1, "userId": 1}'


## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

1. User
2. Question
3. Answer
4. Comment

For detailed schema information, refer to `/prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Architectural Choices

1. **Soft Delete for Users**: Users are not permanently deleted but marked as archived, preserving their content.

2. **File Structure**: Repository files are colocated with routing files for easier navigation.

3. **Query Management**: Complex queries are separated into repository files.

4. **Database Indexing**: Appropriate indexes are created for optimized query performance.

5. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated on ingress to ensure data integrity.

6. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP errors and responses are implemented for better error management.

7. **Docker Integration**: The application is containerized for consistent development and deployment environments.

8. **Prisma ORM**: Used for type-safe database queries and migrations.

9. **Next.js API Routes**: Utilized for creating serverless API endpoints.
