# Vision Extract

Vision Extract is a Django-based project that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to parse images of PDFs and extract financial data from statements.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vision-extract
   

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   
   poetry install
   

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   
   OPENAI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   

## How to Run

1. Apply database migrations:
   
   poetry run python vision/manage.py migrate
   

2. Start the Django development server:
   
   poetry run python vision/manage.py runserver
   

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Available Endpoints

- `/pdf_viewer/{pdf_name}`: Renders the specified PDF in a webpage.
- `/pdf_viewer/process`: Processes all PDFs in the `source_pdfs` directory.
- `/extractions/sample`: Provides JSON output of the extractions from the sample PDF.

## How to Test

Run the tests using pytest:

poetry run pytest


## Architecture

The project is structured as a Django application with two main components:

1. `pdf_viewer`: Handles PDF rendering and processing.
2. `extractions`: Manages the extraction of financial data from PDFs.

Key architectural choices:

- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent parsing of PDF contents.
- Implements a page-by-page summarization technique to extract relevant information.
- Utilizes Pydantic for structured data modeling and validation.
- Employs Django's built-in admin interface for easy management.

## Sample Data Model

While the current implementation doesn't explicitly define models, the project is set up to work with financial data. A potential data model could include:

python
class FinancialStatement(models.Model):
    account_number = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    account_holder = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    portfolio_value = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2)

class Holding(models.Model):
    statement = models.ForeignKey(FinancialStatement, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cost_basis = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2)


This README provides an overview of the project setup, running instructions, and architectural decisions. As the project evolves, you may want to update this file with more detailed information about models, API endpoints, and usage examples.
