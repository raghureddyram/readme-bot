# Vision Extract

Vision Extract is a Django-based application for processing and viewing financial data from PDF statements using AI services, specifically leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4o.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/raghureddyram/vision-extract.git
   cd vision-extract
   

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   
   poetry install
   

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   

4. Run database migrations:
   
   poetry run python vision/manage.py migrate
   

## How to Run

1. Start the Django development server:
   
   poetry run python vision/manage.py runserver
   

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Endpoints

- `/pdf_viewer/{pdf_name}`: Renders the specified PDF in a webpage.
  Example: `http://localhost:8000/pdf_viewer/sample`

- `/pdf_viewer/process`: Processes all PDFs in the `source_pdfs` directory, converting relevant pages into images.
  Example: `http://localhost:8000/pdf_viewer/process`

- `/extractions/sample`: Provides a JSON output of the extractions made from the sample PDF.
  Example: `http://localhost:8000/extractions/sample`

## How to Test

Run tests using pytest:

poetry run pytest


## Architecture

The project consists of two main Django apps:

1. `pdf_viewer`: Handles PDF rendering and image conversion.
2. `extractions`: Manages the extraction of financial data from PDFs using AI services.

### Key Components:

- `AiService`: Handles interactions with the OpenAI API for data extraction.
- `ImageConverter`: Manages PDF to image conversion.
- Django views and templates for rendering the web interface.

## Data Flow

1. PDFs are uploaded to the `source_pdfs` directory.
2. The `/pdf_viewer/process` endpoint converts relevant PDF pages to images.
3. The `/extractions/{pdf_name}` endpoint processes these images using OpenAI's GPT-4o to extract financial data.
4. Extracted data is returned as structured JSON.

## Future Improvements

- Implement database models for storing extracted data.
- Add user authentication and authorization.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
- Implement more comprehensive testing.
