## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose:
   - For Windows and Mac: Download and install from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
   - For Linux: Follow the Linux-specific instructions on the Docker installation page.

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Build the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - API routes: `localhost:3000/api/[entity]`
   - Prisma Studio: `localhost:5555`

## Project Structure

- `/app`: Contains Next.js application files
- `/pages/api`: API routes for questions, answers, comments, and users
- `/prisma`: Prisma schema, migrations, and seed data

## API Routes

- Questions: `/api/questions`
- Answers: `/api/answers`
- Comments: `/api/comments`
- Users: `/api/users`

Each entity supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations where applicable.

## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- User
- Question
- Answer
- Comment

Refer to `/prisma/schema.prisma` for detailed schema information.

## Testing

Currently, there are no specific testing instructions provided in the project files. It's recommended to add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Additional Notes

- The project uses soft delete for users, preserving their content even after deletion.
- Indexes have been added to improve query performance.
- The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
